* Instead of, or in addition to, Solovay-Kitaev, you might also mention Selinger-Ross, which is more efficient (and in fact optimal).
* p31 "we are likely to find gates that are classically controlled": discuss somewhere how this is caused by the current crop of quantum algorithms and the current form of compilers/languages like quipper
* p38/39: this discussion presumes a fixed algorithm. What if we want one single architecture for a universal setup that can run various algorithms? Then you don't know ahead of time which nodes will be "servers", nor how to choose the hyperparameter mu or eta.
