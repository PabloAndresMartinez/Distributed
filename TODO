* p29 the hypergraph picture is unclear; the reader hasn't seen the notation for hyperedges before, and instead might expect something like https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1175/drawing-a-hypergraph 
* Similarly, explain the notation for cuts somewhere early, both in circuits and in hypergraphs.


* Instead of, or in addition to, Solovay-Kitaev, you might also mention Selinger-Ross, which is more efficient (and in fact optimal).
* p31 "we are likely to find gates that are classically controlled": discuss somewhere how this is caused by the current crop of quantum algorithms and the current form of compilers/languages like quipper
* p38/39: this discussion presumes a fixed algorithm. What if we want one single architecture for a universal setup that can run various algorithms? Then you don't know ahead of time which nodes will be "servers", nor how to choose the hyperparameter mu or eta.


* Finish interchange CNOT section (and revise it)
* Revise Evaluation chapter
* Check bibliography is well formatted
* Make sure footnote 8 is in the right page
