\section{Further work}


Better implementation (integrated in Quipper from a data-structure point of view; this should make the program faster)

Introduce more functionality:
  - CNOT interchange optimisation.
  - Black boxes: Sometimes we know some part of the circuit requires a lot of interaction between some qubits. If we tell the algorithm in advance to consider that circuit fragment as a black box which can not be distributed, the hypergraph should be way simpler, and therefore the partitioner should be able to find a better overall distribution.
  - Non-uniform partition: some QPUs get more vertices (this is trivial)
